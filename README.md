# FXXKED AGENT

## What is this?

This is my attempt to build some interesting agents who live in environments created by pygame(or by Gymnasium later), 
with neural networks as their brain. Some reinforcement learning vibes.

For now, Here's a bot aimed to survive in a 2D environment. His tasks are: 1.to avoid stepping out, 
2.not to revisit positions within certain steps. The bot has an LSTM as its brain.

## How?

Just run play.py to see what happens.

## Why?

I plan to extend this to more complex situations later.


Have fun!
